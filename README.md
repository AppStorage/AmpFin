# AmpFin
A native Jellyfin music client for iOS 17 written using SwiftUI and SwiftData. This app was created in like 5 days, so it is not the most feature-rich application, but it works perfectly fine and supports

- Online & Offline Playback
- View Artists
- View Albums
- Search your library
- Time-synced lyrics (requires Jellyfin 10.9 [unstable])
- Queue including history
